    Use the `CloudletsPolicy` data source to list details about a policy with and its specified version, or latest if not specified.

    ## Basic usage

    This example returns the policy details based on the policy ID and optionally, a version:

    ```python
    import pulumi
    import pulumi_akamai as akamai

    example = akamai.get_cloudlets_policy(policy_id=1234,
        version=1)
    ```

    ## Attributes reference

    This data source returns these attributes:

    * `group_id` - Defines the group association for the policy. You must have edit privileges for the group.
    * `name` - The unique name of the policy.
    * `api_version` - The specific version of the Cloudlets API.
    * `cloudlet_id` - A unique identifier that corresponds to a Cloudlets policy type. Enter `0` for Edge Redirector, `1` for Visitor Prioritization, `3` for Forward Rewrite, `4` for Request Control, `5` for API Prioritization, `6` for Audience Segmentation, `7` for Phased Release, `8` for Input Validation, or `9` for Application Load Balancer.
    * `cloudlet_code` - The two- or three- character code for the type of Cloudlet. Enter `ALB` for Application Load Balancer, `AP` for API Prioritization, `AS` for Audience Segmentation, `CD` for Phased Release, `ER` for Edge Redirector, `FR` for Forward Rewrite, `IG` for Request Control, `IV` for Input Validation, or `VP` for Visitor Prioritization.
    * `revision_id` - A unique identifier given to every policy version update.
    * `description` - The description of this specific policy.
    * `version_description` - The description of this specific policy version.
    * `rules_locked` - Whether editing `match_rules` for the Cloudlet policy version is blocked.
    * `match_rules`- A JSON structure that defines the rules for this policy.
    * `match_rule_format` - The format of the Cloudlet-specific `match_rules`.
    * `warnings` - A JSON encoded list of warnings.
    * `activations` - A list of of current policy activation information, including:
      * `api_version` - The specific version of the Cloudlets API.
      * `network` - The network, either `staging` or `prod` on which a property or a Cloudlets policy has been activated.
      * `policy_info` - A list of Cloudlet policy information, including:
          * `policy_id` - An integer identifier that is associated with all versions of a policy.
          * `name` - The name of the policy.
          * `version` - The version number of the policy.
          * `status` - The activation status for the policy. Values include the following: `inactive` where the policy version has not been activated. No active property versions reference this policy. `active` where the policy version is currently active (published) and its associated property version is also active. `deactivated` where the policy version was previously activated but it has been superseded by a more recent activation of another policy version. `pending` where the policy version is proceeding through the activation workflow. `failed` where the policy version activation workflow has failed.
          * `status_detail` - Information about the status of an activation operation. This field is not returned when it has no value.
          * `activated_by` - The name of the user who activated the policy.
          * `activation_date` - The date on which the policy was activated in milliseconds since epoch.
      * `property_info` A list of Cloudlet property information, including:
          * `name` - The name of the property.
          * `version` - The version number of the activated property.
          * `group_id` - Defines the group association for the policy or property. If returns `0`, the policy is not tied to a group and in effect appears in all groups for the account. You must have edit privileges for the group.
          * `status` - The activation status for the property. Values include the following: `inactive` where the policy version has not been activated. No active property versions reference this policy. `active` where the policy version is currently active (published) and its associated property version is also active. `deactivated` where the policy version was previously activated but it has been superseded by a more recent activation of another policy version. `pending` where the policy version is proceeding through the activation workflow. `failed` where the policy version activation workflow has failed.
          * `activated_by` - The name of the user who activated the property.
          * `activation_date` - The date on which the property was activated in milliseconds since epoch.
