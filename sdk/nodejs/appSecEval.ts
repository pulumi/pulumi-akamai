/**
 * **Scopes**: Security policy
 *
 * Issues an evaluation mode command (`Start`, `Stop`, `Restart`, `Update`, or `Complete`) to a security configuration.
 * Evaluation mode is used for testing and fine-tuning your Kona Rule Set rules and configuration settings.
 * In evaluation mode rules are triggered by events, but the only thing those rules do is record the actions they *would* have taken had the event occurred on the production network.
 *
 * **Related API Endpoint**: [/appsec/v1/configs/{configId}/versions/{versionNumber}/security-policies/{policyId}/eval](https://developer.akamai.com/api/cloud_security/application_security/v1.html#postevaluationmode)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Basic usage:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as akamai from "@pulumi/akamai";
 *
 * const configuration = akamai.getAppSecConfiguration({
 *     name: "Documentation",
 * });
 * const evalOperation = new akamai.AppSecEval("evalOperation", {
 *     configId: configuration.then(configuration => configuration.configId),
 *     securityPolicyId: "gms1_134637",
 *     evalOperation: "START",
 * });
 * export const evalModeEvaluatingRuleset = evalOperation.evaluatingRuleset;
 * export const evalModeExpirationDate = evalOperation.expirationDate;
 * export const evalModeCurrentRuleset = evalOperation.currentRuleset;
 * export const evalModeStatus = evalOperation.evalStatus;
 * ```
 * ## Output Options
 *
 * The following options can be used to determine the information returned, and how that returned information is formatted:
 *
 * - `evaluationRuleset`. Versioning information for the Kona Rule Set being evaluated.
 * - `expirationDate`. Date when the evaluation period ends.
 * - `currentRuleset`. Versioning information for the Kona Rule Set currently in use on the production network.
 * - `evalStatus`. If **true**, an evaluation is currently in progress; if **false**, evaluation is either paused or is not running.
