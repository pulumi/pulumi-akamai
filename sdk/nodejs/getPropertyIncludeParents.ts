/**
 * Use the `akamai.getPropertyIncludeParents` data source to return a list of parent properties that use the given include. In your property's rule tree, you can reference an include by adding the `include` behavior and specifying the `includeId`.
 *
 * ## Basic usage
 *
 * This example returns all active properties a specific include is referenced in, based on the contract, group, and include IDs.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as akamai from "@pulumi/akamai";
 *
 * const myExamplePropertyIncludeParents = akamai.getPropertyIncludeParents({
 *     contractId: "ctr_1-AB123",
 *     groupId: "grp_12345",
 *     includeId: "inc_123456",
 * });
 * export const myExample = myExamplePropertyIncludeParents;
 * ```
 *
 * ## Attributes reference
 *
 * This data source returns these attributes:
 *
 * * `parents` - The list of include's parent properties.
 *  * `id` - The property's unique identifier.
 *  * `name` - The descriptive name for the property.
 *  * `stagingVersion` - The property version currently activated on the staging network.
 *  * `productionVersion` - The property version currently activated on the production network.
 *  * `isIncludeUsedInStagingVersion` - Whether the specified include is active on the staging network and is referenced in parent's `stagingVersion`.
 *  * `isIncludeUsedInProductionVersion` - Whether the specified include is active on the production network and is referenced in parent's `productionVersion`.
