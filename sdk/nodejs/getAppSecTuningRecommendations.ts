/**
 * Returns tuning recommendations for the specified attack group or rule (or, if both the `attackGroup` and the `ruleId` arguments are not included, returns tuning recommendations for all the attack groups and rules in the specified security policy).
 * Tuning recommendations help minimize the number of false positives triggered by a security policy. With a false positive, a client request is marked as having violated the security policy restrictions even though it actually did not.
 * Tuning recommendations are returned as attack group or rule exceptions: if you choose, you can copy the response and use the `akamai.AppSecAttackGroup` resource to add the recommended exception to an attack group or the `akamai.AppSecRule` resource to add the recommended exception to a rule.\
 * If the data source response is empty, that means that there are no further recommendations for tuning your security policy or attack group.
 * If you need, you can manually merge a recommended exception for an attack group or a rule with the exception previously configured.
 * You can find additional information in our [Application Security API v1 documentation](https://techdocs.akamai.com/application-security/reference/get-recommendations).
 *
 * **Related API endpoint**: [/appsec/v1/configs/{configId}/versions/{versionNumber}/security-policies/{policyId}/recommendation](https://techdocs.akamai.com/application-security/reference/get-recommendations)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Basic usage:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as akamai from "@pulumi/akamai";
 *
 * const configuration = akamai.getAppSecConfiguration({
 *     name: _var.security_configuration,
 * });
 * const policyRecommendations = configuration.then(configuration => akamai.getAppSecTuningRecommendations({
 *     configId: configuration.configId,
 *     securityPolicyId: _var.security_policy_id,
 * }));
 * export const policyRecommendationsJson = policyRecommendations.then(policyRecommendations => policyRecommendations.json);
 * const attackGroupRecommendations = configuration.then(configuration => akamai.getAppSecTuningRecommendations({
 *     configId: configuration.configId,
 *     securityPolicyId: _var.security_policy_id,
 *     rulesetType: _var.ruleset_type,
 *     attackGroup: _var.attack_group,
 * }));
 * export const attackGroupRecommendationsJson = attackGroupRecommendations.then(attackGroupRecommendations => attackGroupRecommendations.json);
 * ```
