/**
 * Use the `akamai.PropertyInclude` data source to get details about a specific include.
 *
 * ## Basic usage
 *
 * This example returns details for an include based on contract, group, and include IDs.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as akamai from "@pulumi/akamai";
 *
 * const myExamplePropertyInclude = akamai.getPropertyInclude({
 *     contractId: "ctr_1234",
 *     groupId: "grp_5678",
 *     includeId: "inc_9012",
 * });
 * export const myExample = myExamplePropertyInclude;
 * ```
 *
 * ## Attributes reference
 *
 * This data source returns these attributes:
 *
 * * `name` - The descriptive name for the include.
 * * `type` - Specifies the type of the include, either `MICROSERVICES` or `COMMON_SETTINGS`. Use this field for filtering. `MICROSERVICES` allow different teams to work independently on different parts of a single site. `COMMON_SETTINGS` includes are useful for configurations that share a large number of settings, often managed by a central team.
 * * `latestVersion` - Returns the most recent version of the include.
 * * `stagingVersion` - The include version currently activated on the staging network.
 * * `productionVersion` - The include version currently activated on the production network.
