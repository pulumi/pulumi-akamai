/**
 * Use the `akamai.getPropertyIncludeRules` data source to query and get an include's rules. This data source lets you search across the contracts and groups you have access to.
 *
 * ## Basic usage
 *
 * This example returns the include's rule tree based on the specified contract, group, and include IDs:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as akamai from "@pulumi/akamai";
 *
 * const myExamplePropertyIncludeRules = akamai.getPropertyIncludeRules({
 *     contractId: "ctr_1-AB123",
 *     groupId: "grp_12345",
 *     includeId: "inc_123456",
 *     version: 3,
 * });
 * export const myExample = myExamplePropertyIncludeRules;
 * ```
 *
 * ## Attributes reference
 *
 * This data source returns these attributes:
 *
 * * `rules` - Include's rules as JSON.
 * * `name` - The descriptive name for the include.
 * * `ruleErrors` - Rule's validation errors. You need to resolve returned errors, as they block an activation.
 * * `ruleWarnings` - Rule's validation warnings. You can activate a version that yields non-blocking warnings.
 * * `ruleFormat` - Indicates the versioned set of features and criteria that are currently applied to a rule tree. See [Rule format schemas](https://techdocs.akamai.com/property-mgr/reference/rule-format-schemas) to learn more.
 * * `type` - Specifies the type of the include, either `MICROSERVICES` or `COMMON_SETTINGS`. Use this field for filtering. `MICROSERVICES` allow different teams to work independently on different parts of a single site. `COMMON_SETTINGS` includes are useful for configurations that share a large number of settings, often managed by a central team.
