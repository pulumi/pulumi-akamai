/**
 * **Scopes**: Security policy
 *
 * Returns information indicating which of your Kona Rule Sets (if any) need to be updated. A value of **false** indicates that no updates are required.
 *
 * **Related API Endpoint**: [/appsec/v1/configs/{configId}/versions/{versionNumber}/security-policies/{policyId}/rules/upgrade-details](https://developer.akamai.com/api/cloud_security/application_security/v1.html#getupgradedetails)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Basic usage:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as akamai from "@pulumi/akamai";
 *
 * const configuration = akamai.getAppSecConfiguration({
 *     name: "Documentation",
 * });
 * const upgradeDetails = configuration.then(configuration => akamai.getAppSecRuleUpgradeDetails({
 *     configId: configuration.configId,
 *     securityPolicyId: "gms1_134637",
 * }));
 * export const upgradeDetailsText = upgradeDetails.then(upgradeDetails => upgradeDetails.outputText);
 * export const upgradeDetailsJson = upgradeDetails.then(upgradeDetails => upgradeDetails.json);
 * ```
 * ## Output Options
 *
 * The following options can be used to determine the information returned, and how that returned information is formatted:
 *
 * - `outputText`. Tabular report showing changes (additions and deletions) to the rules for the specified security policy.
 * - `json`. JSON-formatted list of the changes (additions and deletions) to the rules for the specified security policy.
