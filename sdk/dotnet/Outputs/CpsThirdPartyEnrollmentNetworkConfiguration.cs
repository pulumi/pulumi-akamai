This option allows the visitors on your site to query the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) server at regular intervals to obtain a signed time-stamped OCSP response. This response must be signed by the CA, not the server, therefore ensuring security. Disable OSCP Stapling if you want visitors to your site to contact the CA directly for an OSCP response. OCSP allows you to obtain the revocation status of a certificate.
