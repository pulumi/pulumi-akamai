Choose `CH` or `CH2` for a more global map. A narrower local map minimizes the origin server's load, and increases the likelihood the requested object is cached. A wider global map reduces end-user latency, but decreases the likelihood the requested object is in any given parent server's cache.  This option cannot apply if the property is marked as secure. See `Secure property requirements` for guidance.
