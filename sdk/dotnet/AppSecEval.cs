    /// Issues an evaluation mode command (`Start`, `Stop`, `Restart`, `Update`, or `Complete`) to a security configuration.
    /// Evaluation mode is used for testing and fine-tuning your Kona Rule Set rules and configuration settings.
    /// In evaluation mode rules are triggered by events, but the only thing those rules do is record the actions they *would* have taken had the event occurred on the production network.

    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// Basic usage:
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Akamai = Pulumi.Akamai;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt;

    ///         Name = "Documentation",
    ///     });
    /// 
    ///     var evalOperation = new Akamai.AppSecEval("evalOperation", new()
    ///     {
    ///         ConfigId = configuration.Apply(getAppSecConfigurationResult =&gt; getAppSecConfigurationResult.ConfigId),
    ///         SecurityPolicyId = "gms1_134637",

    /// 
    /// The following options can be used to determine the information returned, and how that returned information is formatted:
    /// 
    /// - `evaluating_ruleset`. Versioning information for the Kona Rule Set being evaluated.
    /// - `expiration_date`. Date when the evaluation period ends.
    /// - `current_ruleset`. Versioning information for the Kona Rule Set currently in use on the production network.
    /// - `eval_status`. If **true**, an evaluation is currently in progress; if **false**, evaluation is either paused or is not running.
